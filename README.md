# Image-to-image-translation-Progress-and-applications

Image synthesis is uniquely position to give us insight into the working of deep learning by
providing a visual representation for inner happenings. The culture of open-sourcing models in the
learning community also allows non-academics access to these models. Therefore progress made
and applications of these advancements is interesting to both technical and non-technical people.

## Purpose – The purpose of this short paper is to reflect on the progress being made in the image-to-
image translation from a less technical perspective. We compare three models pictorially (as appose
to using metrics) from a layman perspective.
## Design/methodology/approach – In order to reflect on the progress made we introduce the key
components of popular techniques and the models used. After this we conduct some experiment in
which we compare a select few examples on common data sets. We do so using an “easy to
translate” data-set, followed by a more challenging one. We then comment on our findings,
speculating as to why and when the model performs well and do not perform well.
In the appendix we perform further analysis constructing a data-set to strengthen evidence of our
speculations.
## Findings – We find that image-to-image translation techniques have made large improvements over
the last 5 years. Previously supervised models could translate images across similar domains.
Recent unsupervised models are almost able to translate across very different domain, some for
which no current mapping exists. We found that current models can easily translate a human face
into an anime face but the inverse translation proved to be more difficult.
## Practical implications – Investigations like these can be performed with a mid-range desktop PC
and open-source code. This allows individuals to take part in community driven research and/or use
these models in application of their own. Due to the limited hardware we cannot reproduce the
results of some other experiment.
## Research limitations/implications – Image-to-image translation techniques have seen a large
amount of growth in the last 5 years. We can anticipate more growth due to funding from private
industries and interest from other related academic fields.
